# Mam Nature Swiss AG

> Mam Nature Swiss AG provides Swiss-engineered water filtration, revitalization, and anti-limescale solutions precisely designed to deliver natural, safe, and mineral-rich drinking water at home.

## Unique Technology
Our exclusive, 100% natural filtration technology combines **natural protein fibers** with **activated carbon** to achieve total adsorption. This world-first technology removes:
- PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances)
- Heavy metals (Lead, Copper, Aluminium)
- Chlorine, Fluoride, Pesticides, Pharmaceutical residues
- Industrial chemicals (Phenol, Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium)
- Microplastics
- Radioactive substances

**Crucially, our selective filtration preserves all essential minerals and trace elements naturally present in the water.** Our filters function without electricity, salt, or chemicals, and use copper and iron hydroxide to maintain a sterile cartridge.

## Products

### 1. Water Fine Filter (The Essential)
A high-capacity (up to 1800 liters/hour), point-of-entry (whole house) or point-of-use filtration system. It removes hazardous contaminants while retaining minerals. The medical-grade stainless steel housing comes with a 10-year warranty. 
**Lifespan**: Filters up to 150m³ of water (typically lasts 1 year).

### 2. Water Dynamizer (Revitalization)
A pure copper device that revitalizes water using a triple vortex system, inspired by Viktor Schauberger's principles. It restructures water clusters, increases oxygenation, and energetic value, making the water taste like fresh mountain spring water. No electricity or maintenance required.

### 3. Anti-Limescale Solutions (Water/Lime & Particle Filters)
- **Water Lime Filter**: A polyphosphate-free, salt-free system that protects pipes, appliances, and boilers from limescale build-up while preserving water potability.
- **Particle Filter**: Removes sediment, rust, and sand from incoming water, protecting the downstream Fine Filter.

### 4. Hydrogen Booster
A portable device that enriches filtered drinking water with molecular hydrogen (H2), a powerful antioxidant.

### Complete Sets
We offer bundled solutions for comprehensive home water treatment:
- **Eco Set**: Fine Filter + Dynamizer
- **Complete Set**: Fine Filter + Dynamizer + Limescale Protection
- **Plus Versions**: Add a Hydrogen Booster to the respective sets.

## Certifications
Our technology is rigorously tested. The Swiss Water Cartridge retention rates are certified by **ETH Zurich**, and our stainless steel housings are pressure-tested by the **Swiss Safety Center**.
